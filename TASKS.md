## Phase 2: Core Domain Models

### 2.1 Entity Classes
- [ ] 📋 **Create Transaction entity** with comprehensive fields
- [ ] 📋 **Create FraudAlert entity** for flagged transactions
- [ ] 📋 **Create AuditLog entity** for full audit trails
- [ ] 📋 **Create Customer and Account entities**

### 2.2 Repository Layer
